## ðŸš§ NEXT UP - PHASE 1: Property URL Integration

### 1.1: Property URL Input Fields
- [ ] Add property URL input field for residential properties in sidebar
- [ ] Add property URL input field for commercial properties in sidebar
- [ ] Add button next to each URL field (button text TBD - maybe "View Property" or "Open Listing")
- [ ] Button opens the URL in a new tab when clicked

### 1.2: URL Storage & Query Parameters
- [ ] Include property URLs in query parameters so they're preserved in shareable calculator URLs
- [ ] Add property URL to query parameters for residential (`property_url`)
- [ ] Add property URL to query parameters for commercial (`comm_property_url`)
- [ ] Implement callback-based updates for URL fields

### 1.3: Test Complete Sharing Experience
- [ ] Test that shared links include both calculator settings AND property URLs
- [ ] Verify recipient gets complete context: calculations + direct access to property listing
- [ ] Ensure investment team can share analysis back and forth with full context intact

## ðŸ”® FUTURE - PHASE 2: Auto-Population from URLs

### 2.1: Auto-Population Button & Logic
- [ ] Add second button next to URL fields (maybe "Get Information" or "Import Data")
- [ ] Auto-populate **only the sidebar input fields** from listing URL in real-time
- [ ] Extract data via MCP, N8N, or similar integration

### 2.2: Data Extraction Scope (Sidebar Fields Only)
**Residential:**
- [ ] Purchase Price
- [ ] Down Payment % (if available)
- [ ] Expected Monthly Rent
- [ ] State/Location

**Commercial:**
- [ ] Purchase Price  
- [ ] Down Payment % (if available)
- [ ] Annual Gross Rents
- [ ] Annual NOI (if available)
- [ ] State/Location

### 2.3: Platform Integration
- [ ] LoopNet listing data extraction
- [ ] Zillow property data extraction
- [ ] Other major listing platforms (Crexi, etc.)

**Note:** Tax rates, insurance rates, and all calculated fields remain hard-coded in the app. Only extract user-input fields from the left sidebar.

## ðŸ“‹ PROJECT NOTES & TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Implementation Guidelines
- **Residential functionality**: Keep unchanged and fully preserved
- **Commercial calculations**: Different metrics than residential (NOI vs rent/occupancy)
- **Excel source validation**: ALL commercial logic sourced from `Commercial_Prop_Screening_Tool.xlsx`
- **State consistency**: Both property types default to California
- **Input system**: Callback-based updates prevent sticky behavior

### Excel Formula References (Completed Implementation)
- Tax Rate Lookup: `=SUMIF(P2:P7,H1,O2:O7)` âœ…
- Amount Down Calculation: `=H3*H5` âœ…  
- NOI Estimation: `=(K4*(1-L5))-SUM(J8:J11)` âœ…
- Cash-on-Cash Return: `=L10/L11` (Cash Flow Ã· Cash Down) âœ…

### State Data Tables (Implemented)
- **Tax Rates**: AZ(0.62%), CA(1.25%), IN(1.37%), NV(0.65%), TX(1.7%), MI(3.21%) âœ…
- **Insurance Rates**: AZ(0.5%), CA(1.25%), IN(0.5%), NV(0.5%), TX(0.5%), MI(0.5%) âœ…

### Context Continuity Notes
- **Current Status**: Full-featured calculator with URL sharing, responsive inputs, and professional documentation
- **Architecture**: Streamlit + callback-based inputs + query parameter state management  
- **Next Milestone**: Property URL integration (Phase 1) to enable investment team collaboration
- **Use Case**: Investment team shares calculator links with property context - analyze â†’ share â†’ collaborate â†’ decide
- **Long-term Vision**: Auto-populate sidebar fields from listing URLs (Phase 2) for faster property evaluation
